    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p> I love music because it makes me feel good and distracts me from all the
    upsetting things that might be happening around me. I espicially enjoy the catchy
    beats but lofi music is also good for when i'm studying or reading.</p>
    
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>I love to travel becuase I enjoy seeing different parts of the world
    and exploring their beautiful landmarks. They are many countries that i wish to
    go and I hope I go soon! Such as south korea and cuba. I love the culture learned 
    and language. </p>
    
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Gaming. I enjoy playing video games such as nintendo, minecraft and roblox. They are
    super fun. I love to play them with my friends. In my opinion, vidoe games are a super fun way
    to spend your free time if you're bored.</p>
